This project includes data from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign

The dataset contains more than 50,000 images of different traffic signs. It is further classified into 43 different classes. The dataset is quite varying, some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images. The size of the dataset is around 300 MB.
To get started with the project, download and unzip the file from this link https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BGDHe6qQwrBEgnl-tXTSKo6TvDj8U3wS
And extract the files into a folder such that you will have a train, test and a meta folder.

The traffic_signs.py is one for the training of models while python gui.py is for the user interaction.
